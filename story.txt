So I was walking passed this Schloss, right? 
Then there was this beautiful Hund that looked like a Brot. 
The hund then crossed the Biergarten to get to the other side.
In order to make it onto the other side, I sideswiped a hideous porsche while vigorously singing along to Rammstein. 
So I drove my shiny BMW to the Biergarten.
I was so exhausted I accidently dropped my Bratwurst and someone tripped on it and fell down a flight of stairs.
I went to Schloss again, So I could eat Gebaeck  and Apfelkuchen
I was too enamored by my gebaeck that I crossed the Hauptstrasse without first checking my lederhose, only for them to fall down in the center of the road. 
That was not the sole accident that occurred. A Porsche and BMW collided with each other.
Finally, I was able to escape the dangerous accident, avoiding life-altering changes, and made it to the Flughafen.
The klimaanlage inside the flughafen was so refreshing it put my mind at ease and I could recall fond memories of the Brot-Hund.
But alas, the flughafen had no working klimaanlage, and I was roasting and upset!
It was far too hot to remain in my lederhose, so I purchased a lovely Dirndl that breathed like Egyptian cotton.
Then I thought back and asked myself "What is a Biergarten?"
I was so mad that I turned on heavy metal music by Rammstein and rocked out my frustration.
I felt like I was working in a Baeckerei and I was the brot!
Thankfully my wettbewerbsfaehig nature kept me going and I decided that I would just walk my way to the nearest gebaeck.
I had to quickly run off to a ratskeller nearby that would provide the klimaanlage I desired.
I finally arrived at the Eltz Schloss, where I indulged in a delicious Mehlehase, and it was a great dish.
